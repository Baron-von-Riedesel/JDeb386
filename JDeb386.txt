
 1. About JDeb386

  JDeb386 is a ring 0 debugger for Jemm386/JemmEx. It's using DebugRV,
 a variant of the ring0 debugger core DebugR. It can be used to debug any
 program running in the context of a v86-monitor program ( JemmEx/Jemm386),
 in both protected-mode and v86-mode.


 2. Usage
 
  JDeb386 is a JLM and uses JLoad to load itself in the v86-monitor address
 context. To install, just enter JDeb386. Once JDeb386 is loaded and
 initialized, it will become active when

  - an exception is detected; this includes debug exceptions and breakpoints
  - SysReq ( Alt & Print ) is pressed; may not work with all keyboard drivers

  To unload JDeb386 from memory, one has to run JLoad explicitely:
  
    JLoad -u JDeb386.exe

  For a description of the debugger commands see Debug.txt.


 3. Keyboard Layouts

  If no serial connection is used, the debugger will use low-level keyboard
 access. This method needs information about the current keyboard layout.
 The default layout is US. If this is to be changed: there's a tool provided,
 PKLay.exe, that may patch the JDeb386.exe binary with a known keyboard layout.
 The layout data that PKLay.exe uses is contained in file KbdLay.bin. This file
 currently has entries for US, GR and FR - further layouts may be added.
  Be careful when using PKLay - there are only minimal security checks!


 4. Features & Restrictions

 - Since JDeb386 is a JLM it has no DOS memory footprint. Also, since it
   doesn't modify the IVT, it's very hard for programs to detect it, and even
   harder to protect against it.
   
 - JDeb386 needs at least Jemm v5.83.

 - JDeb386 does not handle protected-mode software that runs as VCPI client
   ( DOS extenders ). Those run in their very own context, with different
   address space (CR3), GDT and IDT.

 - If a debugger command causes an exception - page or protection faults
   mostly -, then these are reported; Such errors won't do any harm and don't
   change the debuggee state.
 
 - If pressing SysReq won't stop in the debugger, the BIOS/keyboard driver
   may need a little help - then try SReqHlp.exe! Note that this is a very
   simple TSR, it won't check if it's already installed, so be sure to launch
   it just once.

 - If the debugger is active, interrupts are disabled. So system time will get
   "delayed" over time.

 - JLoad installs a subset of the Win9X ring 0 API, which uses interrupt 20h
   in protected-mode as a sort of dynamic link mechanism. JDeb386 is unaware
   of this API and handles Int 20h like any other software interrupt - that is,
   it might write a breakpoint instruction ( int 3 ) just behind the Int 20h.
   This should cause a GPF, since the Int 20h API expects two words as
   arguments just behind the Int 20h. So if an Int 20h is seen, one has to
   either avoid the T(race) cmd [using G(o)] or set TM 1.
